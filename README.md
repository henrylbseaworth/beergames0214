=============

Week of June 2, 2014 beer games.

Due: Monday, June 9 as close to 4:35 pm MST as possible.

Challenge
-----
Develop a program that takes two inputs, a text file and a key (the key can be any ascii string but the text file could be any text encoding). The program searches the text file for the key. If the key is found the program inserts the number of occurrences of the key up to that point in the document next to that key. The changes will be made in-place for simplicity of checking.

Example
-----
Given the following text file

    hi my name is bacon and this email is getting longer than expected. have you ever thought about bacon ^ bacon && bacon?

and our key is "bacon", then the resulting text file could be:

    hi my name is bacon(1) and this email is getting longer than expected. have you ever thought about bacon(2) ^ bacon(3) && bacon(4)?

You can use any languages/libraries/hax. Whoever completes the program is invited to a bar to drink beer. Whoever "wins" the challenge chooses the bar
